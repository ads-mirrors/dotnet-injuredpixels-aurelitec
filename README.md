# InjuredPixels (for Windows)
InjuredPixels can help you check your PC, laptop or tablet screen for dead pixels, scratches or defects.

InjuredPixels can be used to test a new LCD monitor before purchasing, or an already purchased monitor during the warranty period (as you may get a replacement according to the manufacturer's dead pixel policy). InjuredPixels fills the entire screen with a primary or custom color, allowing you to inspect the screen for pixels that do not match the selected color.

The program is easy to use: click or use the arrow keys to cycle through colors or right-click to get the menu with the main commands. InjuredPixels can be run directly without having to install it on your computer: just download the portable version and run.
